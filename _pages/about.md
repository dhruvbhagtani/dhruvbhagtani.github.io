I am a final-year PhD student in the Climate and Fluid Physics group (supervisor: Andy Hogg), Research School of Earth Sciences, Australian National University. I use numerical models to understand better the interplay between winds and surface heat fluxes in driving large-scale ocean circulation, with an emphasis on gyres.

I obtained a Bachelors of Technology (with honours) degree in Ocean Engineering and Naval Architecture from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, India in Aug 2020. For my honours project, I parallelised a finite-element based solver to estimate cyclone inundation in coastal regions. 

Beginning Feb 2025, I will be starting a postdoctoral position in the Department of Geosciences, Princeton University with Laure Resplandy to develop heat, carbon, and oxygen budgets using ocean models.
