I am a final-year PhD student in the Climate and Fluid Physics group, Research School of Earth Sciences, Australian National University. I use numerical models to understand better the interplay between wind stress and surface buoyancy forcing in driving large-scale ocean circulation.

I obtained a Bachelors of Technology (with honours) in Ocean Engineering and Naval Architecture from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, India in May 2020. For my honours project, I parallelised a finite-element based solver  to estimate cyclone inundation in coastal regions.
