I am a final-year PhD student in the Climate and Fluid Physics group, Research School of Earth Sciences, Australian National University. I use numerical models to understand better the interplay between wind stress and surface buoyancy forcing in driving large-scale ocean circulation.

I obtained a Bachelors of Technology (with honours) in Ocean Engineering and Naval Architecture from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, India in May 2020. For my honours project, I parallelised a finite-element based solver  to estimate cyclone inundation in coastal regions. #II I Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
